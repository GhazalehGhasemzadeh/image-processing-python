# 🖼️ Image Processing with Python

## 📌 Overview
A university project demonstrating basic image processing techniques using Python and OpenCV. The project includes custom Python scripts for applying filters, edge detection, and visual transformations on sample images.

## 🔧 Features
- Grayscale conversion
- Gaussian blur and sharpening filters
- Edge detection using Canny and Sobel
- Thresholding and binary masking
- Input/output image handling

## 📁 Repository Contents
- `/code/` – Python scripts (`filters.py`, `edge_detection.py`, etc.)
- `/images/` – Sample input images and processed outputs
- `report.pdf` – University project report (in Persian)
- `README.md` – This documentation

## 🧠 Tools & Skills Used
- Python
- OpenCV (cv2)
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook (optional)

## 💻 How to Run
Make sure Python and OpenCV are installed:
```bash
pip install opencv-python
python filters.py
